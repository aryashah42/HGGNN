*In progress*

• Developing and implementing Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Networks (HSGNNs) to analyze Electronic Health Records (EHRs), leading to improved diagnosis prediction accuracy using tools such as PyTorch.
• Applying Graph Neural Networks and leveraged large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive modeling and extract insights from clinical notes, using frameworks like TensorFlow and spaCy.
• Utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis and multi-omics data integration techniques to predict clinical outcomes.
• Implementing data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to handle high-dimensional temporal data and reduce noise in graph-based models, using SciPy.
